Most recent project for the recipe manager/grocery ordering dream. <br>

preceded by 'flask_api': https://github.com/RyanEliopoulos/flask_api <br>

Backend for 'flask_api_frontend': https://github.com/RyanEliopoulos/flask_api_frontend <br>
That repo was originally the frontend for 'flask_api'. I do not remember what motivated me to abandon 'flask_api' and create this repo.
